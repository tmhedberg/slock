slock (custom distribution)
===========================
Taylor M. Hedberg <tmhedberg@gmail.com>

This is a customized distribution of slock, the simple X11 screen locker from
suckless.org.

Changes from the base distribution include:

* +config.mk+ tweaked for Arch Linux
** Updated paths to X11 libs and headers
** Set compiler to GCC (This probably doesn't matter)
* Removed the requirement to grab the mouse cursor before locking. This didn't 
  play nicely with another utility I use (hhp), which grabs the mouse cursor
  and hides it after a few seconds of inactivity.

The original +README+ included with the suckless.org distribution is provided as 
+README.orig+.
